# Bootstrap-Portfolio
A portfolio Website
This project was to improve and iterate on my previous portfolio website using Bootstrap. The previous site made use of CSS flexbox. I aimed to keep the functionality of the previous site but I did not want to make some changes to the appearance. The site is to be fully responsive. 

# Challenges

I was attempting to build upon a website that I had already built, but by using different tools. The main challenges were learning about what bootstrap offers and how I can incorporate this into my site.

# What I learned

I learned a lot about bootstrap and its components. I learned about how responsiveness works in Bootstrap. Using a custom CSS while also using Bootstraps predefined stuff. I also imported a font from Google Fonts into my site. 

Here are some screenshots of the application. They show what the site looks like at different breakpoints.
